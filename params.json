{"name":"Gscholaranalysis","tagline":"Attempting to adapt functions for Google Scholar analysis","body":"# gScholarAnalysis\r\n\r\nI saw [this post] (http://tuxette.nathalievilla.org/?p=1682) a few weeks ago on [R-bloggers] (http://www.r-bloggers.com/). It was an interesting idea of pulling down your Google Scholar data, processing it some and extracting interesting bits about it. The post that inspired this person is [here] (http://rogiersbart.blogspot.fr/2015/05/put-google-scholar-citations-on-your.html), wherein he pulled down his data and made a simple plot showing how many publications he had per year since the first one. It's an interesting proof-of-concept, but this plot already prominently sites on your Google Scholar profile page. What interested me was the co-author index and the word cloud from your publications' titles.\r\n\r\n```R\r\nget_all_publications = function(authorid) {\r\n  # initializing the publication list\r\n  all_publications = NULL\r\n  # initializing a counter for the citations\r\n  cstart = 0\r\n  # initializing a boolean that check if the loop should continue\r\n  notstop = TRUE\r\n \r\n  while (notstop) {\r\n    new_publications = try(get_publications(my_id, cstart=cstart), silent=TRUE)\r\n    if (class(new_publications)==\"try-error\") {\r\n      notstop = FALSE\r\n    } else {\r\n      # append publication list\r\n      all_publications = rbind(all_publications, new_publications)\r\n      cstart=cstart+20\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n  return(all_publicationss)\r\n}\r\n``` \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
